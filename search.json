    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2023-24 Boston Celtics season was not just dominant, it was historic. The Celtics utilized math and analytics to secure one of the most dominant championship runs in recent NBA history. The Celtics posted an offensive rating over 122 by the season’s end, which is the highest in NBA history by far. Offensive rating is a statistic that measures a team’s offensive efficiency by calculating the points scored over 100 possessions. I felt this was an important metric because when comparing teams from different decades, this can take into account the pace of play. When comparing the 2023-24 Celtics to other all-time great teams like the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls or the 2016-17 Warriors, the numbers make it clear, the Celtics didn’t just score more than everyone else, they changed how basketball was played.\nChart 1\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\noffense &lt;- read_csv(\"celticsOrtg.csv\") \ntop20 &lt;- offense |&gt; \n  filter(\n    ORtg &gt; 114.6\n  )\n\nbulls &lt;- top20 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"1995-96CHI\"\n  )\n\nwarriors &lt;- top20 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"2016-17GSW\"\n    \n  )\nceltics &lt;- top20 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"2023-24BOS\"\n  )\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(Team, ORtg), weight=ORtg), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=bulls, aes(x=reorder(Team, ORtg), weight=ORtg), fill = \"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_bar(data=warriors, aes(x=reorder(Team, ORtg), weight=ORtg), fill = \"#1D428A\") +\n  geom_bar(data=celtics, aes(x=reorder(Team, ORtg), weight=ORtg), fill = \"#007A33\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n      labs(\n    x=\"Season and Team\", \n    y=\"Offensive Rating\", \n    title=\"The 23-24 Boston Celtics Had the Best Offensive Season in NBA History\", \n    subtitle=\"How do the Celtics stack up against other all-time greats?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Camden Rine\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023-24 Celtics show that they are towering above all other all-time offensive juggernauts. When looking at why this is, I point to their line-ups. They used balance and spacing. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown obviously carried the offensive load, but what is interesting is the supporting cast. Every player they put on the court was a highly capable three-point shooter. With guys like Kristaps Porziņģis and Al Horford, who are usually your “big men,” always roaming around the three-point line with exceptional spacing, always being a threat from behind the arc, defenses were always on their toes, knowing they had to treat everyone like a sharp shooter. While the 2016-17 Warriors revolutionized spacing and shooting, the 2023-24 Celtics perfected it.\nChart 2\nNow let’s take a look at three-point volume, the heart of this transformation, in my opinion. Shown are the top 20 teams of all-time in three-point attempts and how many they made.\n\n\nCode\nthreeattempts &lt;- read_csv(\"celtics3pa.csv\")\n\ntop20attempts &lt;- threeattempts |&gt; \n  filter(\n    `3PA` &gt; 2560\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=top20attempts, \n    aes(y=Team, x=`3PA`, xend=`3P`),\n        size = 2,\n    colour = \"gray\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Threes Made vs Threes Attempted\",\n    title=\"The Celtics are Changing the Game of Basketball\", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Threes made&lt;/span&gt; in a single season are on the left. &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Threes attempted&lt;/span&gt; are on the right consisting of teams with the most threes attempted in a season.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Camden Rine\"\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023-24 Boston Celtics actually did not shoot the most threes in NBA history. Surprising? Maybe, but when you look at the two teams ahead of them, it’s the Celtics from the year before, and the year after! This further shows how far they have taken this three-point revolution. So yes, we have seen how successful the Celtics have been with the three-point shot the past three years, so then the question is, why haven’t other teams tried this analytical strategy? Well, they have, the two teams at the top of the dumbbell chart, the 2024-25 Cavaliers and eventual champion Thunder, shot and made near the most threes all time as well! This further shows that the Celtics have seriously changed the NBA as we know it.\nChart 3\n\n\nCode\nts &lt;- read_csv(\"celticsts%.csv\")\n\ntopts &lt;- ts |&gt; \n  filter( `TS%` &gt; 0.588 ) |&gt; \n  select(Team, `TS%`, `eFG%`, `FG%`)\n\ntopts |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    `TS%` = \"True Shooting Percentage\",\n    `eFG%` = \"Effective Field Goal Percentage\",\n    `FG%` = \"Field Goal Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Are the 2023-24 Boston Celtics the best shooting team of all time as well?\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2023-24 Celtics have the best true shooting percentage in a season of all time.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Camden Rine  |  **Source:** Basketball Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(4)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(`TS%`, `eFG%`, `FG%`),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#007A33\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"2023-24BOS\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the 2023-24 Boston Celtics the best shooting team of all time as well?\n\n\nThe 2023-24 Celtics have the best true shooting percentage in a season of all time.\n\n\nTeam\nTrue Shooting Percentage\nEffective Field Goal Percentage\nField Goal Percentage\n\n\n\n\n2023-24BOS\n60.9%\n57.8%\n48.7%\n\n\n2023-24OKC\n60.8%\n57.3%\n49.9%\n\n\n2024-25CLE\n60.7%\n57.8%\n49.1%\n\n\n2017-18GSW\n60.3%\n56.9%\n50.3%\n\n\n2022-23BOS\n60.0%\n56.6%\n47.5%\n\n\n2016-17GSW\n59.7%\n56.3%\n49.5%\n\n\n2018-19GSW\n59.6%\n56.5%\n49.1%\n\n\n2023-24MIN\n59.4%\n55.9%\n48.5%\n\n\n2015-16GSW\n59.3%\n56.3%\n48.7%\n\n\n2024-25OKC\n59.3%\n56.0%\n48.2%\n\n\n2024-25BOS\n59.1%\n56.1%\n46.2%\n\n\n2006-07PHO\n59.0%\n55.1%\n49.4%\n\n\n2007-08PHO\n59.0%\n55.1%\n50.0%\n\n\n2017-18HOU\n59.0%\n55.1%\n46.0%\n\n\n2023-24DEN\n58.9%\n56.2%\n49.6%\n\n\n1984-85LAL\n58.9%\n55.1%\n54.5%\n\n\n\nBy: Camden Rine | Source: Basketball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking above this basically ties everything together, showing how much the Celtics’ strategy paid off. With the best true shooting percentage season in NBA history at 60.9%, and an effective field goal percentage of 57.8%, the 2023-24 Boston Celtics combined record volume, with record efficiency. That is the balance that no team before has ever been able to replicate, shooting and making more shots than anyone in history.\nThis Celtics team didn’t just have a great year, they had THE year. They created a blueprint for the modern NBA as we know it. I imagine teams across the league have scrambled to study their spacing, roster construction, and shot selection patterns in hopes of achieving similar success. The Celtics did something no team has been able to perfect before, using analytics and math to their advantage, proving that smart basketball can be beautiful basketball, too."
